In Kerala, the Kurumba people primarily inhabit the Palakkad and Idukki districts. They are traditionally forest dwellers and are known for their intimate knowledge of the natural environment, including the flora and fauna of the Western Ghats. Their language, Kurumba, is part of the Dravidian language family and shares linguistic ties with both Tamil and Kannada, though it has distinct features that set it apart from these major languages.",

      "description": "In the Attapadi region of Kerala's Palakkad district, indigenous tribal communities like the Irulas, Mudugas, and Kurumbas reside, each with their own Dravidian languages. The Irula and Muduga languages are closely related, with influences from Tamil and Kannada, while the Kurumba language, though part of the Dravidian family, is more distinct from the others. These languages are primarily oral and are deeply intertwined with the cultural practices of these tribes. However, they are endangered due to the influence of dominant languages like Malayalam and Tamil, and efforts are ongoing to preserve them through cultural and educational initiatives. Yet, given the rising influence of technology and modern education, the survival of these languages may be increasingly challenging. Comprehensive and urgent interventions are needed to protect this cultural heritage.",
